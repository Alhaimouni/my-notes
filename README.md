## What i've learnd
<br>


One of the points that i learnd from 
[good-developer-mindset](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/) is the following :

- Your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.

- You should add logging in a very early stage. This will help you to find the problem easily and save your time.
- Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
